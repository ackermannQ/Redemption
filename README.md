# Redemption
## Goal
The purpose of this project was to get to know Unity, used to build 2D/3D games. Indeed, a very large amount of features are available and the workflow is kinda different than eveything I know. Attaching scripts to characters and objects is something else ...
It allowed me to learn a bit of C# too, I really enjoyed designing the level, thinking about the story and creating this world !

## Sum-up

You are waking up in a weird place. You don't know what you are doing here or even how. The last thing you remember is that you
were driving late at night after a couple of drinks, it was raining.
Try to escape this dark place and figure out what happened !
